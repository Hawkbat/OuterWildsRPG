Riebeck
Solanum

Chert's Scout + Launcher
Feldspar's Jetpack (increased thrust)
Gossan's Helmet
Gabbro's Spacesuit (insulation)

Esker's Signalscope (increased signal angle? idk)
Hal's Translator (Can translate Stranger text)

Make more perks
Add clearer indicator of perk points remaining
Add perks for increasing inventory space

Weird bug with some icons not showing in the inventory after consuming a marshmallow can
Trigger reveals and reload card lists when refreshing graph mode

Truly misc quests should probably get their own psuedo-quest bucket in the UI (like Skyrim/Fallout)

LOADING SAVES IS BROKEN, MAYBE? IT ISN'T MARKING COMPLETED STEPS/QUESTS AS COMPLETE ON LOAD

Reduce save data space some
Maybe clear out started and completed steps and started quests lists once quest is completed

See about running in the Eye scene, for an ending quest

Hide dialogue icons when in dialogue, viewing slide reels, etc.

Add a dialogue-style icon for Nomai recorders, cairns, and text

Fix shop dialogue translations

Auto-generate shop dialogue nodes for buying and selling

Add inventory size limits and reject pickups if they would exceed size limits
Add indicator somewhere of remaining golden marshmallows (use the fancy icons!)


The dialogue tree code is fairly vestigial
_mapDialogueNodes is only used for resolving option targets when selecting them
_listOptionNodes is initialized but never used
With some minimal patches we could probably make a dynamic dialogue provider fairly easily
