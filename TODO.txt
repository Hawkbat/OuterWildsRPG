Make more perks
Add clearer indicator of perk points remaining
Add perks for increasing inventory space

Weird bug with some icons not showing in the inventory after consuming a marshmallow can
Trigger reveals and reload card lists when refreshing graph mode

Truly misc quests should probably get their own psuedo-quest bucket in the UI (like Skyrim/Fallout)

LOADING SAVES IS BROKEN, MAYBE? IT ISN'T MARKING COMPLETED STEPS/QUESTS AS COMPLETE ON LOAD

Reduce save data space some
Maybe clear out started and completed steps and started quests lists once quest is completed

See about running in the Eye scene, for an ending quest

Hide dialogue icons when in dialogue, viewing slide reels, etc.

Add indicator somewhere of remaining golden marshmallows (use the fancy icons!)

Okay, let's pull the trigger on this OWItem tracking system
Add a 'hotbar' inventory of items for the player to pick up
This new item inventory should be separate from equipment and ship inventory
Add a property to Drops to indicate the physical item they correspond to
Allow auto-generated OWItem drops to inherit from explicitly defined drops
On system load, loop through drops in any list and see if they match physical OWItems
If a match is found and the item is set to not respawn, disable the physical OWItem
When a Drop with a paired OWItem is highlighted in the hotbar, enable and equip it using vanilla item system
When an OWItem is set down, re-enable its associated DropPickup
Add hotbar cards to inventory screen, to move items back and forth (may need new prompts/actions)
Use toolOptionLeft/toolOptionRight controls and prompts to scroll through hotbar
Only while ItemTool or no tool is equipped

Icons overlapping
Tephra nameplate stays
Special dialogue icon for signs (and recorders)
Indicator of how many golden marshmallows you have
Buff to make ghost matter visible
Add random snapshots from the rewind in the pause menu
Quest UI is hidden while flying the ship
